# Linux_shell_scripting
I was part of a team with [Mazilu Andrei](https://github.com/deiandrei) and [Onetiu Radu](https://github.com/OnetiuRadu). We created a shell and we implemented some basic functions.
Here are the commands: exit, cd, ls, pwd, history, exec, time, date, sysinfo, clear, find, co, mkdir, rm, shutdown, reboot.
